title: What do I want this to be?
---

What I want this to be, I am still unsure. On some glance I want this to be a doc section with all the documentation that I need for everything personal. I want to info dump here too. Maybe get back to the hobby of blogging and feel like it's 2014 again. Main point in deciding it is I want this section to as originally as authentically capture me that I feel content with it's content and not something that will be focused on something on only one aspect of my life. Dunno. Thanks for reading!
