Here's a list of things I'm currently working on, and hit me up if you want to have a cup of coffee on any of them!

#### [**Python Crash Course**](https://pythoncrashcourse.softr.app/)
I'm currently on a very short break from teaching Python to beginners. I'll be back soon!

The motivation behind the 7 day course was to give beginners an idea on what goes around in the world of programming to help them better understand the field and make a decision on whether they want to pursue it or not.
    
I'm also working on a longer course for beginners, so stay tuned! And if you want to help collaborate, [email me](mailto:muhtasimhossain43@gmail.com)


#### **PDF to Website Builder**
Working on a project that uses hugo to build a website builder from pdfs/ppts.

The idea is to make it easier for people to build portfolio websites without having to learn HTML/CSS/JS and for me to learn hugo better.

The project is being built in public (#buildinpublic) and you can follow along [here](https://twitter.com/muhtasimhossain/status/1664398458172870657)
