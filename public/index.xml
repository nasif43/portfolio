      <description>cgpa-calculatorAfter seeing a lot of my close friends struggle calculating or estimating their CGPA for on-going courses I have taken it upon myself to dedicate one night towards trying to solve this problem. Am I a hero? I don&amp;#39;t know. Am I on my 99th cup of coffee and procrastinating work by hyper fixating on this? Maybe. Goodnight!

      <description>Here&amp;rsquo;s a list of things I&amp;rsquo;m currently working on, and hit me up if you want to have a cup of coffee on any of them!
Python Crash Course I&amp;rsquo;m currently on a very short break from teaching Python to beginners. I&amp;rsquo;ll be back soon!
The motivation behind the 7 day course was to give beginners an idea on what goes around in the world of programming to help them better understand the field and make a decision on whether they want to pursue it or not.</description>
